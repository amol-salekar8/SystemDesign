# Objects In Kubernetes



### Understanding Kubernetes objects
- Kubernetes **objects are persistent entities** in the Kubernetes system.
- Kubernetes **uses these entities to represent the state of your cluster**.
- Specifically, they can **describe**:
  - What containerized applications are running (and on which nodes).
  - The resources available to those applications.
  - The policies around how those applications behave, such as restart policies, upgrades, and fault-tolerance.
- To **work with Kubernetes object**s : whether to create, modify, or delete them you'll need to use the **Kubernetes API**.
